                    The question “Who am I?” has preoccupied both philosophers and academics alike for millennia. The
                    ancient scriptural wisdom of India explains that the bodies we see with our eyes – white, black,
                    Indian, European, Greek, Chinese – are temporary, external designations. The real person, the spirit
                    soul, dwells within. It is not that we should claim “I have a soul”. In fact you are the soul. The
                    real understanding is, “I am a soul and I have a body”. When the body dies, the soul continues to
                    live and moves onto another destination.

                    If there is life, it is the symptom of the presence of a soul. When a soul is present, all living
                    things undergo six changes: they are born, they grow, they endure for a while, they produce
                    offspring, they dwindle and then they die. These six stages can be seen in plants, animals, insects
                    and even microbes although the duration of each stage will differ. If these six stages are present
                    it means there is the presence of a soul which is the cause of these changes. Once the soul leaves,
                    the organism dies

                    As spirit souls, we originate from the spiritual sky – which one may consider to be heaven. We have
                    fallen into the material world which is a temporary place, and we become conditioned by its laws
                    (the modes of material nature). Therefore we forget who we really are. We then believe that we are
                    these bodies and act to satisfy our senses. Since sense pleasure is temporary, we will always remain
                    unsatisfied. We often attempt to increase our sense enjoyment more and more and in quite diverse
                    ways. To think that we can achieve real happiness through the mind, body and senses is an illusion.
                    One who does not know the difference between the material and spiritual realities is considered
                    materially conditioned.

                    God has many names, but God is one. When we refer to God as the “Supreme” Lord, then there can only
                    be one “Supreme” or it renders the term meaningless. The analogy of the Sun can be used to explain
                    this idea. The Sun in Spanish is called ‘sol’, in English is called ‘sun’ and in Swahili is called
                    ‘jua’. However none of those languages can have any claim of proprietorship over the Sun. It is not
                    the Spanish Sun any more than it belongs to the people of Africa; it is the same sun that shines
                    everywhere. Similarly, God is one and he has different names. Krishna is the original name of God in
                    Sanskrit, which means ‘The All Attractive One’. Nobody in any religion denies the all attractive
                    nature of God.

                    ‘Krishna’ means God. We are all intimately connected with Him because He is our original father. But
                    we have forgotten this connection. When we become interested in knowing “What is my connection with
                    God? What is the aim of life?” then we are God conscious or Krishna conscious.

                    This is the mantra for liberation in this age. Mantra means spiritual sound vibration. Material
                    sounds affect us on the material emotional, psychological and intellectual levels, and clutter our
                    consciousness. Spiritual sound vibrations, in particular, this Maha-mantra (the greatest chant for
                    deliverance in this age) connects with who you really are (the soul) and revives our dormant
                    spiritual consciousness. It re-awakens the conditioned soul to his real identity. The mantra is not
                    a sectarian chant belonging to a particular religion. It is a chant of names of God and can be
                    chanted by anyone. It is a transcendental sound vibration that connects with the spirit soul; the
                    soul cannot be Muslim, Hindu, Christian or Jew; the soul is simply what it is – pure spirit.

                    ‘Veda’ means knowledge. The Vedas are the original knowledge that is revealed at the time of the
                    universe’s creation. Life in the material world is a combination of matter and spirit. The Vedic
                    literature is a vast body of knowledge divided into four main treatises that covers diverse aspects
                    – from science, mathematics, architecture, astronomy, military science, politics, architecture,
                    medicine and even cuisine. Just as a device or appliance comes with an instruction manual, the Vedas
                    educate one about the purpose and proper use of this material world to avoid being further
                    implicated in its laws. The ultimate purpose of the Vedas is to lead one to liberation from the
                    material nature.

                    Western science and philosophy explain that the law of causality governs all actions and events in
                    the universe. Actions and events have corresponding reactions on the material platform. The Vedic
                    texts, which predate Western science, call this principle of action and reaction ‘karma’. The spirit
                    soul, which is entrapped in the material nature, acts in particular ways which can cause it either
                    further bondage or liberation from the laws of nature. An individual’s actions bring about his or
                    her transmigration from one body to another. One cannot become free from karma simply by refraining
                    from action. One has to learn the art of working without accruing karma, which is the process of
                    bhakti yoga.

                    Four principles of all religions are identified: truthfulness, compassion, austerity and
                    cleanliness. For one practicing spiritual life, it is essential to understand the activities which
                    destroy these principles. The Vedas explain that the following activities destroy the universal
                    principles:

                    Gambling destroys truthfulness. Gambling does not only refer to betting with money, but speculative,
                    dishonest, or illicit business dealings. The increase in dishonesty, greed, anxiety and loss of
                    equilibrium destroys the elevating quality of truthfulness.

                    Killing animals destroys compassion. Institutionalised animal slaughter is organised violence. In
                    the act of killing an animal, there is a conspiracy by the party of sinners, and all of the sinners
                    are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being.
                    He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks
                    the animal, he who administers distribution of the foodstuff, and at last he who eats such animal
                    food are all murderers, and all of them are liable to be punished by the laws of nature. All these
                    activities destroy compassion. No one can create a living being despite all advancement of material
                    science, and therefore no one has the right to kill a living being by one’s independent whims.

                    Unrestrained sex indulgence destroys austerity. Sexual indulgence causes excessive attachment to the
                    body and bodily pleasures and thus entrenches one in the false conception the one is the body.
                    Sexual indulgence has been excessively prompted by media and advertising, and such unrestrained
                    sexual activity has resulted in several social, emotional and psychological problems in society.

                    Intoxication destroys cleanliness. Intoxication, which includes cigarettes, alcohol, drugs and even
                    caffeine, are unnatural to the body, and often lead to addiction. These habits often lead to loss of
                    life, loss of mental health, disease, premature aging and an inability to naturally focus the mind
                    intelligently and steadily on any task. The addictions escalate until the individual loses all
                    reason, and leads to the miserable state of existence in which all cleanliness is destroyed.

                    Devotees of Krishna commit to following the four regulative principles of no meat-eating, no
                    gambling, no intoxication and no illicit sex.

                    The yoga that the West is familiar with in the form of exercises is but just one small part of a
                    series of steps known as ashtanga or hatha yoga.

                    Hatha yoga was actually practiced by ancient sages in quiet places to control the mind and senses to
                    improve meditation on God. The West has appropriated only the yoga postures. Of course, modern
                    society and medicine has realised the positive health benefits of hatha yoga and has promoted it.
                    Many yoga practitioners use the exercises for improving fitness, but not many of them adopt the
                    deeper values of yoga. Thus it is not uncommon to find people doing yoga, but still smoking, taking
                    alcohol and non-vegetarian foodstuff, or being promiscuous.

                    There are many types of yoga. ‘Yoga’ means ‘linking with the Supreme’. If one wishes to link with
                    the Supreme by analysing the material and spiritual natures by his intelligence, then this is called
                    ‘jnana yoga’.

                    These processes of hatha yoga and jnana yoga are fraught with difficulties and it could take
                    hundreds of years to perfect them.

                    The recommended process for this era is bhakti yoga – linking oneself to the Supreme in a
                    relationship of unconditional loving devotional service. This begins by chanting the Holy names in
                    the form of the Mahamantra and then rendering practical service.

                    By chanting this mantra one can more easily attain perfect self-realisation than all other methods
                    past and present.

                    Scientific reasoning often involves setting up an experiment – there is method, observation and
                    results. Similarly in this process of bhakti yoga, one does an experiment. One can try the chanting
                    (method), observe particular changes in consciousness (observation) and experience the benefits
                    (result). The difference is that science relies on one’s external senses to conduct the experiment,
                    while bhakti yoga is an internal process and revives the dormant spiritual consciousness that is
                    covered by the mind, intelligence and ego.

                    realisations about its truth. As conditioned souls, we have four defects – we are under illusion, we

                    perfect knowledge by direct perception. Aural reception of transcendental knowledge from a bona fide

                    been a few Indian and Western teachers who have claimed to be gurus and taken advantage of the
                    naivety of innocent followers. The Vedas caution the prospective disciple to study the
                    qualifications of the guru carefully and question him about all matters. A very important scripture
                    in the Vedic canon, called the Nectar of Instruction states that “A sober person who can tolerate
                    the urge to speak, the mind’s demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and
                    genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world”.

                    As a check-and-balance, there are three ways that one can establish the bona fide nature of a guru.
                    Firstly, a guru must be coming in an unbroken disciplic succession which can be traced back to the
                    original speaker of the Vedic truths, Lord Krishna. Secondly, whatever the guru says must be
                    verifiable in the scriptural canon. Thirdly, it must also concord with the instructions and
                    descriptions of the teachers that came before him. And, of course, one’s own tangible experience
                    will show oneself: “By following this guru, am I giving up degrading activities and progressing in
                    my spiritual development?” If so, then one has found a true guru.

                    That is called ‘tilak’ (“tee-luck”). It is clay taken from holy places and used to adorn the body of
                    a devotee. Just as you recognise a temple as a special place of worship by its markings, similarly
                    the devotee marks his or her body with tilak to indicate that the body is a temple of God to be used
                    in God’s service. It also indicates that the person’s head is always bowed in a position of
                    submission before God.

                    On a spiritual platform there is no difference between men and women, or any other designation for
                    that matter. Physically, it is obvious there are differences. That’s why men and women take part in
                    their own categories at sports events. Spiritually there is no duality, no inferiority or
                    superiority based on body and mind.

                    In our quest for gender equality, it is also easy to negate that there are differences which
                    influence our activities differently. For example, only women have the natural biological capacity
                    to bear children and nourish them with breast milk. We cannot avoid that difference. However, in
                    Krishna consciousness there is no restriction on women in occupational roles or leadership roles in
                    ISKCON. Several departments are headed by women. We even have precedence in our lineage, just after
                    Lord Chaitanya left this planet 500 years ago, that thousands of devotees were led by Jahnavi Mata,
                    a great female saint.

                    The negative reaction from women to the patriarchal and exploitative attitudes of men toward them is
                    obviously natural. Therefore if one has a spiritual perspective, then ones attitude will be
                    protective rather than exploitative, and one will treat all living beings with equality.

                    Krishna consciousness is the most respectful philosophy of animal and environmental rights that
                    exist in the world.

                    Devotees are strictly vegetarian, we do not eat meat, fish or eggs. That immediately supports animal
                    rights, because we respect their right to live. There is no need to kill animals for the
                    satisfaction of our palates, as the trees and plants are bowing down with vegetables, fruit, grains
                    and nuts for our meals. One may ask, how is it that we are killing the plants? Harvesting does not
                    always kill the plant – apples can be reaped in every season from the same tree. We have to eat, so
                    we take our meals from that kingdom from which we cause the least amount of distress and pain. Still
                    eating vegetables just like that means there is some reaction, therefore devotees prepare, cook and
                    offer vegetarian meals guided by spiritual principles of cooking given in the Vedas.

                    Vegetarianism and a simpler lifestyle sustains the environment. The meat industry contributes
                    largely to deforestation, desertification, water pollution, water shortages, air pollution, and soil
                    erosion. Half of the Amazon rain forests have been cleared for cattle ranching, 40% of the land in
                    Western United States is used for rearing beef livestock, 50% 0f the world’s grain suitable for
                    human consumption are fed to cattle whilst millions of humans remain starving and undernourished.
                    All the soybean and grain fed to US livestock in a year could feed 1.3 billion people.

                    Moreover, no other philosophy reveres the cow like the Vedas instruct. The cow is regarded as the
                    mother of mankind as she sustains all with life giving milk. Devotees therefore protect the cow and
                    will not even think of slaughtering her. Calves should have the first right to any milk that a
                    mother cow produces, and whatever is left over is available to humans.

                <p>
                    Yes, and yes. The word ‘reincarnate’ derives from the root ‘carna’ which means ‘flesh’. Reincarnate
                    therefore means to enter into the flesh again. The Vedas explain that the spirit soul is eternal;
                    the real person, the spirit soul never dies. In the natural course of life the body grows from a
                    baby to youth to boyhood, middle age, then old age and death, and then transmigrates into another
                    body at death. Your destination depends upon your thoughts at death, and what we think of at the
                    time of death depends on what we have been absorbed in for most of our lives. Thus spiritual
                    training is needed for one to remember a spiritual destination at the time of death or one will
                    continue in the cycle of birth and death.

                    The Vedas contain amazing stories of reincarnation. The Western sceptic, of course, wants scientific
                    evidence. One can study the work of the late Dr. Ian Stevenson who investigated and recorded cases
                    of reincarnation or that of Dr. Michael Sabom and others. Reincarnation memories often occur in
                    children and as they grow they tend to forget. So if one wanted to confirm a case of reincarnation,
                    investigative work may reveal old civic records of the person in a previous life. For one in the
                    Vedic paradigm, ideas of reincarnation are quite normal.

                <p>
                    ISKCON accepts that God consciousness is universal and all major religions in their authentic form
                    are bona fide. The Vedic understanding is that at particular times empowered agents of God will
                    preach His message to different people all over the world and the message will be given according to
                    time, place and circumstance. Thus it may surprise the practitioners of other religions to know that
                    the empowered representatives of God like Jesus, or Mohammed and Buddha are actually predicted in
                    the ancient Vedas. Srila Prabhupada had utmost respect for other religions and stated:

                    “Who will not respect Jesus Christ? He sacrificed everything for God, even his life. So who is that
                    rascal that he’ll not respect to Jesus Christ. What did [Christ] do wrong to the human society? He
                    did everything for the good of the human society. Oh, I have got very, very, great respect for Lord
                    Jesus Christ.”

                    In the purport of Srimad Bhagavatam (2.4.18) Srila Prabhupada writes:

                    “Jesus Christ and Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on
                    behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe.”

                    With this understanding, ISKCON does not proselytize members of other faiths. We engage in
                    interfaith dialogue with people who are interested with a view to improving the practice of
                    everyone. There are many Christians and Muslims who have adopted the principles of Krishna
                    consciousness in their lives.
